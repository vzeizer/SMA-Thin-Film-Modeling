# SMA modeling through phenomenology

## Introduction

Here it will be shown the basic ideas, as well the realeasing of the code, to investigate thin magnetic films of Shape Memory Alloys.
In this work, the Landau á¹•henomenology of martensitic transformations is used in order to simulate the magnetic hysteresis loops of off-stoichiometric Ni2MnGa.



### Finite-Element Method Modeling 

Here it was used the Finite Element Method (FEM) to discretize the films into smaller parts.
We assume a certain value of the variants and model the whole film as non-interacting domains.
In our approach, we have the coexistence of two mirrored domains.
The growth of one domain is accompanied by the decrease of the other.

### Spherical coordinates of the problem

In our approach, we used spherical coordinates to describe each element as shown in the following figure.

### Strain rotation

The Ni2MnGa thin film is nanocrystalline, i.e., there are variants pointing toward every direction.
Therefore, in order to take into account such a texture, we have got to perform strain transformations.

### Fitting of the Experimental Data


The theory was implemented in Python 3 and the main hysteresis loops were fitted by changing the parameters of the model (assuming close-to-bulk values).
